I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements.  The HTML structure appeared fine, and I was including the Tailwind directives properly in my CSS file, yet the styles weren't being picked up. I checked my `tailwind.config.js` and confirmed all my configurations were correct. I've also confirmed that the `content` array within `tailwind.config.js` correctly points to the relevant HTML files where the classes are used.
