The problem was resolved by explicitly building the Tailwind CSS file.  I was relying on the automatic build process, but it wasn't functioning correctly in my setup.  By executing the command `npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch` in my terminal, I ensured that Tailwind properly processed my configuration and generated the necessary CSS. This command takes in input.css, processes it using tailwind directives, and outputs the result to output.css, and the --watch flag ensures automatic rebuilds on file changes.
